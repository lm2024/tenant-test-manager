# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a high-performance segment-based ID generation service that provides unique, sequential IDs across multiple tenants in a distributed environment. The service will support various ID formats, use Redis for caching, and MySQL for persistence, ensuring high concurrency and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure different ID generation types for different business scenarios, so that I can support various ID formats across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring ID generation THEN the system SHALL support 8-digit sequential IDs from 00000001 to 99999999 with customizable length
2. WHEN configuring ID generation THEN the system SHALL support custom prefix + sequential number format
3. WHEN configuring ID generation THEN the system SHALL support custom suffix + sequential number format  
4. WHEN configuring ID generation THEN the system SHALL support business-type-specific ID lengths and formats
5. WHEN configuring sequence parameters THEN the system SHALL store table name, service name, generation type, step size, and length in the sequence table

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want high-performance ID generation with Redis caching, so that the system can handle high concurrency without database bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating IDs THEN the system SHALL use Redis cache with configurable step sizes (1000 or 3000)
2. WHEN service starts THEN the system SHALL clear Redis cache and reload step information to avoid duplicates
3. WHEN Redis cache is exhausted THEN the system SHALL automatically load the next batch from MySQL
4. WHEN MySQL sequence is exhausted THEN the system SHALL throw an error
5. WHEN generating IDs THEN the system SHALL support high-performance batch generation for Excel imports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want tenant-isolated ID generation, so that each tenant has independent ID sequences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating IDs THEN the system SHALL include tenant context in ID generation
2. WHEN switching tenants THEN the system SHALL use separate ID sequences per tenant
3. WHEN querying sequences THEN the system SHALL filter by tenant ID
4. WHEN managing sequences THEN the system SHALL support tenant-specific configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable starter component, so that I can easily integrate ID generation into other services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the starter THEN the system SHALL provide auto-configuration for Spring Boot
2. WHEN using the starter THEN the system SHALL provide simple annotation-based ID generation
3. WHEN calling the service THEN the system SHALL provide both single and batch ID generation APIs
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error handling and logging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and management capabilities, so that I can maintain the ID generation service effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring the service THEN the system SHALL provide sequence usage statistics
2. WHEN managing sequences THEN the system SHALL support CRUD operations for sequence configuration
3. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging with tenant context
4. WHEN backing up THEN the system SHALL support sequence state export/import functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and testing capabilities, so that I can understand and verify the service functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the service THEN the system SHALL provide complete API documentation
2. WHEN testing the service THEN the system SHALL include test controllers in my-test-execute module
3. WHEN deploying the service THEN the system SHALL provide deployment and configuration guides
4. WHEN integrating THEN the system SHALL provide usage examples and best practices
